{"name":"Zlib","tagline":"A massively spiffy yet delicately unobtrusive compression library.","body":"ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY\r\n\r\nzlib 1.2.8 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is\r\nthread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs\r\n(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files\r\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and\r\nrfc1952 (gzip format).\r\n\r\nAll functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h\r\n(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org).  A usage example\r\nof the library is given in the file test/example.c which also tests that\r\nthe library is working correctly.  Another example is given in the file\r\ntest/minigzip.c.  The compression library itself is composed of all source\r\nfiles in the root directory.\r\n\r\nTo compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at\r\nthe top of Makefile.in.  In short \"./configure; make test\", and if that goes\r\nwell, \"make install\" should work for most flavors of Unix.  For Windows, use\r\none of the special makefiles in win32/ or contrib/vstudio/ .  For VMS, use\r\nmake_vms.com.\r\n\r\nQuestions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>, or to Gilles Vollant\r\n<info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version.  The zlib home page is\r\nhttp://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to\r\nverify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest\r\nversion and check whether the problem still exists or not.\r\n\r\nPLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html before asking for help.\r\n\r\nMark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan.  1997\r\nissue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at\r\nhttp://marknelson.us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/ .\r\n\r\nThe changes made in version 1.2.8 are documented in the file ChangeLog.\r\n\r\nUnsupported third party contributions are provided in directory contrib/ .\r\n\r\nzlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package, documented at\r\nhttp://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/ .\r\n\r\nA Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmqs@cpan.org> is available\r\nat CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, including\r\nhttp://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/ .\r\n\r\nA Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <amk@amk.ca> is\r\navailable in Python 1.5 and later versions, see\r\nhttp://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html .\r\n\r\nzlib is built into tcl: http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610 .\r\n\r\nAn experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top\r\nof zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>, is available in the\r\ncontrib/minizip directory of zlib.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes for some targets:\r\n\r\n- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt\r\n\r\n- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With\r\n  -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32\r\n  compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.\r\n\r\n- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works\r\n  when compiled with cc.\r\n\r\n- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is\r\n  necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.\r\n\r\n- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with\r\n  other compilers. Use \"make test\" to check your compiler.\r\n\r\n- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.\r\n\r\n- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments:\r\n\r\n  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz.  The deflate and\r\n  zlib specifications were written by L.  Peter Deutsch.
