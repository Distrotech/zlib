          <p>ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY</p>

<p>zlib 1.2.8 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950</a> (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and
rfc1952 (gzip format).</p>

<p>All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact <a href="mailto:zlib@gzip.org">zlib@gzip.org</a>).  A usage example
of the library is given in the file test/example.c which also tests that
the library is working correctly.  Another example is given in the file
test/minigzip.c.  The compression library itself is composed of all source
files in the root directory.</p>

<p>To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at
the top of Makefile.in.  In short "./configure; make test", and if that goes
well, "make install" should work for most flavors of Unix.  For Windows, use
one of the special makefiles in win32/ or contrib/vstudio/ .  For VMS, use
make_vms.com.</p>

<p>Questions about zlib should be sent to <a href="mailto:zlib@gzip.org">zlib@gzip.org</a>, or to Gilles Vollant
<a href="mailto:info@winimage.com">info@winimage.com</a> for the Windows DLL version.  The zlib home page is
<a href="http://zlib.net/">http://zlib.net/</a> .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to
verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest
version and check whether the problem still exists or not.</p>

<p>PLEASE read the zlib FAQ <a href="http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html">http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html</a> before asking for help.</p>

<p>Mark Nelson <a href="mailto:markn@ieee.org">markn@ieee.org</a> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan.  1997
issue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at
<a href="http://marknelson.us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/">http://marknelson.us/1997/01/01/zlib-engine/</a> .</p>

<p>The changes made in version 1.2.8 are documented in the file ChangeLog.</p>

<p>Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory contrib/ .</p>

<p>zlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package, documented at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/">http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/compression/</a> .</p>

<p>A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <a href="mailto:pmqs@cpan.org">pmqs@cpan.org</a> is available
at CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, including
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/%7Epmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/">http://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/</a> .</p>

<p>A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling <a href="mailto:amk@amk.ca">amk@amk.ca</a> is
available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html">http://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html</a> .</p>

<p>zlib is built into tcl: <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610">http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610</a> .</p>

<p>An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top
of zlib by Gilles Vollant <a href="mailto:info@winimage.com">info@winimage.com</a>, is available in the
contrib/minizip directory of zlib.</p>

<p>Notes for some targets:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt</p></li>
<li><p>For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With
-O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32
compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.</p></li>
<li><p>zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works
when compiled with cc.</p></li>
<li><p>On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is
necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.</p></li>
<li><p>zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with
other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.</p></li>
<li><p>For PalmOs, see <a href="http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/">http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/</a></p></li>

  zlib specifications were written by L.  Peter Deutsch.  Thanks to all the
